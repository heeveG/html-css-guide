                    <h2>Flexbox Layout</h2><br>
                    CSS Flexbox has become extremely popular amongst front-end developers the last couple of years. This
                    isnâ€™t surprising, as it has made it a lot easier for us to create dynamic layouts and align content
                    within containers.
                    <br><br>Flexbox is the best choice for one dimensional layouts. That means, if you're building a
                    header,
                    for example, Flexbox layout will give a lot of flexibility for such task.
                    <br><br>Flexbox allows elements to align and distribute space within a container. Using flexible
                    widths and heights, elements can be aligned to fill a space or distribute space between elements,
                    which makes it a great tool to use for responsive design systems. <br><br>However, Flexbox should
                    not always be used. Understanding a Flexbox means knowing when to use it. For example Flexbox should
                    not be applied to every single container. Some basic tasks are easily solvable with basic CSS. It's
                    like going to the shop on a tank.
                    <br><br>
                    The examples I will provide you will be both examples when to use or when not to use Flexbox, so you
                    can build your web pages wisely!

                    <h2>Grid Layout</h2><br>
                    Grid layout - is relatively new CSS styling method and it's got a lot of capabilities, just like
                    Flexbox. <br>In some cases it might be better than Flexbox, in others it won't. So it is crucial to
                    understand both methods and apply each, only when there is need to. <br> <br>
                    Unlike Flexbox layout, Grid is made for two dimensional layouts. For example, if you are planning on
                    creating entire layout in two dimensions, which means using both rows and columns, then Grid is your
                    choice.
                    <br><br>
                    Same as the Flexbox method, Grid should not be used for easy tasks, well handled by default CSS.
                    There are many ways to combine the Flexbox and Grid methods and that is what I, personally, find the
                    best decision - combine Flexbox and Grid. For example - use Flexbox for navbars and footers; if you
                    want to line up all items vertically - use Grid; if you want the items to keep their
                    natural width - use Flexbox.
                    <br><br> There are many more examples, some of which I will try to cover, but most of it comes from
                    experimenting, so go ahead - read the last part of this tutorial and apply your knowledge in building a read web-page.
